# Add brochures

## Create a brochure entry

When you become a **Contributor** you will find a new button on the brochures page which open a form to create new brochures. They will be associated with your personal account and no other contributor will have the rights to modify them.

While none of the fields are strictly required, obviously the `title` is desired and also `language` would be nice to have filled in for every brochure so that they can be translated and indexed in the future.

## Upload additional files

When the brochure is created additional media can be uploaded.

If available, first upload a PDF. It's first page will automatically appear as the cover image of the brochure's page.

Additional images can be added later, if desired.
